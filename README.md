Manchester United host Brentford on Wednesday evening, as they look to get back to winning ways and aim for revenge after that 4-0 loss earlier this season.

Thanks to Sunday's woeful 2-0 defeat at Newcastle, the Red Devils are now on their worst run of Premier League form since Erik ten Hag took charge, failing to win any of their last three games. Even so, the mood still isn't as bad as after Brentford memorably put four past them on a boiling-hot day in London back in August.

A nightmare first-half display gave Ten Hag another frightening eye-opener to see how far United had fallen in the years prior to his tenure, but he's certainly been helping bring them back up throughout the course of the campaign. It's also been a positive term for Brentford, who've shown no signs of second season syndrome and sit ninth in the table after drawing away to Brighton on Saturday

Manchester United look to return to winning ways in the Premier League when they face Brentford at Old Trafford on Wednesday night.

The Red Devils come into the game on the back of a hugely disappointing 2-0 defeat at the hands of Newcastle last weekend. The loss means United haven’t won any of their last three top-flight matches, failing to score in the process.

The slump in form has raised doubts about a top-four finish that had looked all but nailed on for much of Erik ten Hag’s first season. It won’t be easy for the hosts however, against a Bees side who dismantled them earlier this season.

Brentford’s 4-0 win back in August marks arguably the lowest point in United’s Premier League history, leaving them bottom of the table. And after another poor run of form, Ten Hag has warned that unless players match certain standards, they will be left out of his side.
But Ten Hag has spoken of a need for his United men to learn lessons from our defeat to Newcastle at the weekend, and three points are required if we are to regain momentum in our hunt for a Champions League place.

Here's everything you need to know about the upcoming encounter, starting with details of the live coverage...
